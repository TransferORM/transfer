Mark Mandel no longer develops Transfer.  If you are starting a 
new project, please use CF ORM instead.  For those with existing
projects using Transfer, this repo is an updated version of the
old pluggable_cache branch with fixes for CF9, CF10 and CF11.  It
has an important fix for stability under load resolved in July
2014.  Upgrading from any 1.1 or 1.2 version is encouraged.
